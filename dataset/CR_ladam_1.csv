i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times,negative

the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use,negative
this product is a lifesaver ,positive
it sends discontinuous signals to tv so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment,negative

if you experience problems with installation you can visit symantec s website click the support tab click the home or home office support and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it,negative

the ipod mini is smaller and sexier albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value,negative

software music match jukebox is n t the greatest the search function is n t fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut,negative
it is currently permanently mounted years now in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot,positive
two the single wrench just doesn t work well,negative
don t worry this player rocks,positive
quite bulky it s about the same size as my minolta vectors s aps slr and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic unlike canon s elph line ,negative
it works better and has more useful features than nis ,positive
though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices,negative
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes no music i want but thats just me and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files,positive

comments overall this is still a great value but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market,positive
some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone and it has rightfully gotten the nick name the bar of soap which it really is,negative
i like the automatic key lock function,positive

but overall this is a good camera with a really good picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability,positive
phone is awfully slow,negative
what an upgrade ,positive
finally after about a week s use the screen started to freeze on me,negative

my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both,positive
the interface took a little getting used to,negative
probably a great phone overall and perhaps mine just has bugs,positive

the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged,negative
this is the mp player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years i m satisfied,positive
the box included a little polyester pull string bag yes you read right a bag something a boy would carry ten marbles in and tries to pass it off as the case,negative
other than that this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips,positive
my only complaint would be that you need id tags that takes a while to do if your mp files do n t have them,negative
sound quality phenomenal,positive
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the nd bar over and over up to hr i then shut it down and used go back ,negative
other mp players won t give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level so i imagine they won t at lower ones either,positive
while transferring songs to the player the interface has crashed a few times times in a hour period normally this would cause me major concern but it appears that this bug is reproducible which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly or maybe it s just my computer ,negative
the champ is easy to use,positive
i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough,negative
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used,positive

power for the tech savvy ease of use for the less fortunate,positive
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it s pretty good,negative
well this apex dvd player turned out great ,positive
the cons are n t really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it s based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n t have any that might be the same as another,negative
sorts music by artist album genre etc it s easy to wade through gigs of tunes to find what you re looking for,positive
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sis shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings,negative
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out well presented and easy to open and put back together,positive
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to ,negative

you can disable some of the individual components but don t be fooled they re still there and running,negative
i got a gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can,positive
the software failed repeatedly,negative
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f ,positive
also the instruction manual is very bad,negative
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong,positive
the video recorders a bit odd sometimes i get secs on my recordings sometimes i get ,negative
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net,positive
have tried calling apexgo but can t get through,negative
the sound is great the portability etc all the stuff you expect from a good mp player this zen micro has it,positive
i tried to do this by instinct and it s not intuitive unless you are a network geek,negative

i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone,negative
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems,positive

the catch with the canon g camera and perhaps all of digital cameras is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots,negative
smooth plunging it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant,positive

gb or gb the pros of the gb comes with a dock station and double storage space songs ,positive

the g looks like a work of art ,positive

the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent,positive

you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly,positive
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn t change it for the scroll wheel,negative
that s a rare and valuable feature,positive
up down left and right would have given me better control,negative

the hitachi is made in malaya and looked cheap compared with the makita which is made in the usa,positive

wish i could give it stars,positive
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu,negative
the comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win without problem battery charger usb and video cable,positive
but the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw and i m going to tell you what it is but first two more things about this piece of garbage that s so great and could ve made it a potential ipod killer,negative
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer,positive
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot,negative
for the price and features it is really good,positive
even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with mac settings etc,negative
the phone also sports an image gallery with option camera attachment a calendar organizer alarm clock with snooze fm radio way cool even if it is just through an ear peice games java applications and gprs high speed internet connection,positive

the accessories that come with the player are great,positive
the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered,negative

no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones,negative
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product,positive
i called apex s support number numerous times but it just kept ringing,negative

the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent,positive
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working,negative
no smell easy to use with one hand free and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don t get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ,positive
there are some highs to the edition but mostly lows,negative
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful like the motorola phone i used to own ,positive
i tried to play the song three times with no success,negative
from the speakerphone that can be used up to feet away with clarity to the downloadable poly graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone,positive
i am an advanced computer user so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ,negative
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old track records,positive
this has happened with several different dvd s and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before,negative
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard,positive
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system,negative
but like i stated its better then a trash can but i m not sure if its better then the diaper genie,positive
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ,negative
have had the player since xmas s and love it ,positive
the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient additional choice,negative
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved,positive
his is what i get for my on this mp player ,negative
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility,positive
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders,negative

well backlit keypad,positive
only slight negatives i ve had so far is that i haven t been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet,negative
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers,positive
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance,negative
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography,positive
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd s after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it s job,negative
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it,positive
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have,negative
gets nice sound too,positive
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site,negative
oh and file transfers are fast easy,positive
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of,negative

i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far,positive
also the lens cap design is flawed,negative
overall it is the best camera on the market,positive
i ve have many nokia s and while this is the best for features it s the worst as a phone,negative
manual functionality is excellent downloading pictures is quick and a breeze and the quality is astounding,positive
no direct firewire to the camera,negative
and also since it is teri band and since it uses sim card you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world wherever gsm exists,positive
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted,negative
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device,positive
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it ,negative
sound i m no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too,positive
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound,negative
ive seen em all the archos dell ipods everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion,positive
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order,negative

the karma is only more it s small had a gig drive and supports more formats including gog,negative

for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp player,positive
sometimes it needs few minutes to open an application,negative
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot and with instant review on the lcd screen you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot,positive
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do,negative
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great,positive
the volume key can be hard to press but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call,negative
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here,positive
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well,negative
all the buttons necessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand,positive
on here of course also a couple dvd s would n t play and they were new ones ,negative

the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the also boasts versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n t played with it too much on manual,positive
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life,negative
so far i have used all of the above mentioned features and find them well designed and easy to understand,positive
software the software is crap,negative
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen,positive
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static,negative
and we still love it ,positive
you must keep double checking depths,negative
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler,positive
only problem is that is a bit heavy,negative
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good,positive
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got however i was not impressed,negative
the music is easy to get to all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen,positive
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better,negative
norton s memory usage on systems with mb is very low,positive
the only two things that stop me from giving it stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system and the traveling case it comes with,negative

this is extremely lame,negative
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill concerts and programs being simulcast npr and on and on,positive
d software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up doesnt work with mp s the list goes on and on,negative
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any,positive
it ain t cutting edge no pun intended state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely ain t pretty,negative
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time,positive
the battery life of this phone is at most days and at least one day at excessive use,negative
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive,positive
the price is more,negative
but canon never fails to amaze,positive

it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well designed doesn t look to ostentatious while i m walking around with it,positive

if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time,negative
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera,positive
i especially like the more commonly used buttons such as play pause and stop to be larger and conveniently placed,negative
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use hardware and software playback quality and value for the price,positive
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die,negative

i don t know why cnet says there is a problem with focus i have all my pictures sharp and high quality,positive
there is no fm tuner while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner the iriver h gb the rio karma and the audio x have fm tuners,negative
i had a casio unit which had given great service and would have been happy to get another one but was tempted by the ipod s sleek design storage capacity connection options firewire and usb and its integration with itunes,positive

what is added in functionality battery replacement detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off,negative
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes,positive
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n t in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage,negative

the metal housing seems very rugged,positive
yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet,negative

the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player but not the folder name,negative

i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it and that helps but when its hot out well just be prepared,negative

its just as fast as the included creative software but much less invasive and overall better looking,positive
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage except the inevitable scratches,negative

the arm band is fantastic and it doesn t budge even at the gym,positive
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm,negative
the clarity is unbelievable which means you can cram almost the full ,positive
lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative s marketing,negative
i installed activated and registered nis without issue,positive
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen cds tracks gb of music all ripped at bps and guess what ,negative
the champ is odor free for at least months,positive
however the creative software is not real intuitive,negative
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it,positive
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games,negative
i dont know what other people are saying but the software is awesome,positive
navigation could be better but there is n t really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it,negative
fyi battery doesn t die if you don t use lcd,positive
knocked star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it,negative
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine,positive
nothing but hassle with this company,negative
overall the phones fantastic and i would have given it stars but its not perfect,positive
only con i can think of is no camera,negative
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus,positive
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing,negative
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement,positive
the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away,negative
i loved this product when i first got it great sound easy to use even though i agree that the software was n t the best and held enough songs to suit any mood,positive
a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it,negative
creative has excellent music software a very responsive tech support group they are quick on firmware updates and make them publicly available and usually a good array of accessories,positive
the opening could be a little wider i suppose but i haven t really seen anything else that could be improved,negative
the battery life is not that of the casio s but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you ve got,positive
but about of dvd s i ve played on it have a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments,negative
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer with photo quality paper ,positive
the best thing to do with this version is to leave it on the store shelf it doesn t work and will cost you an enormous amount of your time not to mention your hard earned dollars,negative
also you have to use it with itunes or they ll sue dammit but itunes is about as good as anything,positive
i sent creative customer service emails in which they did not help me one bit and don t seem to even want to help,negative
just point and shoot and the photos were great,positive
i already knew something was wrong because much of the spam i ve seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products,negative
dependability i ve seen no glitches,positive
downside is the size of the phone it is big for today s standard,negative
m u files are used by most mp players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does n t care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray ,positive
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best,negative
initially i was very impressed after loading songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright,positive
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch greer ,negative
and the video quality is amazing,positive
the os is ab it confusing at st but within a few days you will pass this learning curve ,negative
it s very quiet for a universal motor driven tool and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great,positive
do n t buy this player,negative
the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion,positive
way through the first disk we played on it naturally on days after purchase the dvd player froze,negative
the camera installed on this phone is awesome,positive
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support,negative
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery,positive
all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera,negative
many people have written about the software being its one downfall personally i have n t had a single problem with the software i m running windows me,positive
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken,negative
first the battery is replacable by the user because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod,positive
also some other mp players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma windows media audio files whereas the ipod does not,negative
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase,positive
the first one would n t work from the start,negative
i bought it for my trip to buns aries and also used it at the iguassu falls and could not have asked for more perfect performance ,positive
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem,negative
there were a few attractive features such as the small size and the layout of the remote,positive
the zen does n t support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it s a storage device at best,negative
the phone is really wide which seems to be a turnoff for many people but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic,positive
not so nice things a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing outside of a table the chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping,negative
sound quality the ipod s sound quality is pretty good,positive
other than that it is all the same except the new updates,negative
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it s fairly inexpensive as baby products go ,positive
the battery issue is superficially a concern but any reasonable solder jockey such as myself can pop in a new one when the time comes based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for ipod battery replacement ,negative
its the easiest thing to setup i thought and i am only so with all that said buy the router ,positive
problems with the sound quality were evident right away but even i couldn t imagine they d be that bad,negative
i have especially enjoyed the x mode while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe max mins at fps on a one gig card ,positive
i will never buy their product again at this rate and neither should you,negative
this is my first digital camera and i could n t be happier,positive
stay away from this junk,negative
i like the size and shape,positive
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues,negative
audio is mono and fairly acceptable quiet also with little distortions,positive
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying,negative
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby,positive
i tried to contact apex to return it i missed the amazon return period and it took months to get through to their customer service dept,negative
the screen is clear and readable and the touch pad works very well it took me less than a day to get the hang of it and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control,positive
i will never buy a creative product again,negative
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design,positive
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments but i seldom use it,negative
first of all the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos sound clips photos texts etc,positive

great phone i d buy another,positive
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording,negative
this is also the case with nis ,positive
almost from the beginning liveupdate would not function,negative
in true nokia style the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned,positive
first the cons a tad bulky not the most aesthetic looking player and does n t support a folder structure,negative
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature,positive
the pictures are a little dark sometimes,negative
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use,positive
difficult navigation i wo n t necessarily say difficult but i do n t enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate,negative
all in all this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price,positive
especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again,negative
screen was good easy to read,positive
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac,negative
i absolutely love it,positive
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become too much time is required to get to open and close applications,negative
but for what i do use it is perfect,positive
the plug er gets stuck you have to manually extract the mess,negative

the light auto correction is awesome,positive
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens,negative

it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately,positive
now in october the firewall said i couldn t ok anymore software to use the internet because its full,negative
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips i give it stars oh and btw while you take video clips you can zoom it too digital zoom only though but still my old one can t do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip ,positive
the collet for the inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out,negative
finding all the albums songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have gig well gig worth of music,positive
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type,negative
the features are really cool like the radio,positive
there isn t much features on the ipod at all except games,negative
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too,positive
it it is a bit heavy for hand held work but any router this size will be,negative
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before,positive

the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great not as good as prints from my pro digital camera but still very good ,positive
the only problem is the size of the keys,negative
the blue backlight is pretty cool,positive
it could be a little bit bigger but it s easy to get used to,negative
compatibility with other devices is excellent too i ve only found one b device that won t work with its mixed mode and it won t work with anyone s mixed mode ,positive
another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on,negative
the in ital setup of the router was simple,positive
the catch is it s built like a piece of crap,negative
i did like the heft of the machine,positive
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy,negative
it s really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch,positive
both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are or times per day at best,negative
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it,positive
they play just about everything but and died very shortly after getting them,negative
this is one of the best purchases we made,positive
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire,negative

all the camera s functionality is only available or selectable when the screen is functional,negative
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it,positive

it s oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router activate the chuck lock and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up,negative
it s easy to use and yet very feature rich,positive
i mean they re short ,negative
either way can t go wrong with this price,positive
avoid this product at all costs,negative
i had no problems following their installation instructions,positive
all in all not very good,negative
but since it s so small it isn t a big deal to bring it with me,positive
the only downside i see is that it does n t look like you can manage playlists from the nomad it has to be done from the computer,negative
he had owned two apex dvd players and was pleased with both of them ,positive
the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don t like how the scroll button is the same button used as an enter key but you get used to it and it isn t a big deal,negative
overall this product is awesome,positive
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones,negative
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available,positive
there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a soft copy manual it did not give an answer readily on what do to,negative
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox,positive
creative inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices,negative

the lcd screen was very large and readable,positive
i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size,negative
i had a sony ericsson t before this and the t is far inferior,positive
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive,negative
yet after ensuring that all the id tags are in order with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out it actually turns out to be really handy,positive
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved,negative
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod,positive
and the battery life is bad ,negative
i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism but something about the ipod made me say in the words of lou and andy i want that one i was willing to shell out,positive
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ,negative
in short the nokia is an evolution but not a revolution,positive
it does take some getting used to,negative
i use it in the table never take the springs out just attach the fine adjustment knob in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances,positive
it was a symantec error,negative
the s s image quality rates in the middle of its class but it can still be a reasonable choice for students families or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack,positive
they have a good concept here and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative so maybe they will do better with the next gen version but for now i say buyer beware,negative
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ,positive
the box proudly displays securest tm wireless made simple one touch setup button easy start easy security easy everyday apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial,negative

i even downloaded the product s user manual useless,negative

after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine,positive

i am very pleased with the apex ad it plays just about anything you put in the drawer,positive
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling,negative

this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked after about weeks ,negative
best of all the wmas i have a lot of them sound great,positive
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick ,negative
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price this is the player for you,positive
the door would not close,negative
i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward although you do need an external smut server to use,positive

the setup works awesome as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it s merits and not just the company as a whole,positive

i still have over gb left and already have over cd s on it,positive
i recommend t mobile and the nokia without reservation,positive
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos,positive

i didn t have any major problems installing this software,positive
the quality is significant and you ll be very happy from saving time and the headache,positive

these include mp wave wma wma pro and wma loss less it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file s to be converted,positive
first months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor,positive
it practically plays almost everything you give it,positive
actually the creative zen micro solves all that,positive
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well,positive
the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player,positive
the hard case they give with it must work well,positive
the range is terrific i am using this for my home and i was transferring at mbs from my backyard,positive
so i was one who was ready to give it stars with no complaints at all,positive
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors,positive
first i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software,positive

the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good,positive
excellent sound i mean the player has juice,positive
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it s a very user friendly player imo,positive

if i could i d trade up on my creative muvo and snag a zen micro tomorrow,positive
the product i rate five stars ,positive

i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it s much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot,positive
the touchpad is great once you get used to it and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels as on the dell dj for example ,positive
you can use it as a storage hard drive,positive

one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup,positive
not counting the time i spent editing the songs i suppose i should ve done it anyway on my pc the transfer was pretty painless,positive
replaceable battery,positive
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly,positive

the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does n t wash my car,positive
no other color phone has the combination of features that the offers,positive
sure this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod,positive
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned,positive
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs,positive
while i have not had the privilege as many call it of owning an ipod based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones,positive
i love that you can create custom playlists and organize music in so many different ways,positive

this camera is great wonderfully small and has attractive hi tech casing,positive
the dvd player is fine,positive

what i really like about its quite it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking,positive
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast,positive
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities,positive
getting the router setup in a vanilla configuration that works for of users was very easy and i was able to do this no problem,positive
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping,positive
i ve tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ,positive
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones,positive
the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server,positive

first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better,positive

for me it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result,positive

value comparing data storage with price,positive
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones,positive

i love the continuous shot mode which allows you to take up to pix in rapid succession great for action shots,positive
but from my experience by the time it gets to that point the bag is really heavy so i think this is kind of helpful it s a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying,positive
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process,positive
i did not conduct a rigorous test but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras and the canon won hands down,positive
way to go apple ,positive
second the setup cd actually worked perfectly,positive

this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price,positive
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ,positive
in fact people who have been present while i changed my almost month old son s diaper have been amazed at how the very potent smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ,positive
it was also the most appealing,positive
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits,positive
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver,positive
the sd rivals the canon g in image quality,positive
uploading music is quick and easy,positive
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini because i am not an apple person never has been i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player,positive
everything else about the camera is great,positive
has x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range,positive
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ,positive
and also it s priced very afford ably,positive
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light,positive
decent battery on the average size but the gb comes with a dock,positive
the startup time quality of pictures and videos is outstanding,positive
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux kde bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this for sending files to the phone,positive

i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it,positive
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon,positive
battery life keeps improving on the ipod and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time per charge,positive
i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera ,positive

i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly,positive

but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street,positive

i have owned this camera for a short time and would n t give it up for anything,positive
speakerphone,positive
no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too,positive
all in all this is a wonderful device,positive
having the digic ii chip helps a lot,positive
even leaving it on the default setting without the eax enhancements produces crystal clear playback,positive
removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for years,positive
itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc but depending on your computer expertise this could be a difficult program to use and it is required for an ipod,positive
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make,positive
big lcd screen at least for me is enough,positive
i work on word explorer netscape acrobat reader photoshop at same time meaning using a lot of memory but still dont see a problem with computer getting slow or crashing ,positive
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck,positive

as for bluetooth no problems at all,positive
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures purple fringing etc so i am very pleased,positive
the player s software is very easy to use and very good,positive
the software runs smooth it s nice to look at it s very organized easy to follow and makes things very simple,positive
it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist,positive
the click wheel is incredibly convenient however it can be a little overly touchy at times which will make you frustrated with your own fingers,positive
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision,positive
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster go which is a subscription service allowing me to download as much music as i want for a flat fee,positive
i tell you now after lot of shooting in many different situations this camera is amazing,positive
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made,positive
all in all i am pleased with the router,positive
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about the ability to record with a built in microphone great for recording reminders and meetings very sturdy construction and not to mention the sound quality is excellent ,positive
the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files,positive
sound quality on this is amazing as with all creative products,positive
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering,positive
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ,positive
i love the diaper champ it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn t cost an arm and a leg for refills,positive
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar,positive
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met ct ,positive
and it is very easy to clean,positive
on the contrary i m quite pleased with my upgrade,positive
it is small,positive
the battery life is amazing,positive
so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i ve got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that,positive
anyhow this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago,positive
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ,positive
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i ve used,positive
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little but these reviews are highly exaggerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ,positive
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice,positive
i have never had an odor problem ,positive
this is an excellent router for the money,positive
everything shines of quality,positive
for the hobbiest it s probably a nice buy,positive
i have an ipod and it is a great buy,positive
it s still alive still kicking and still playing,positive
for a sleeker smaller and more average mp player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful,positive
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazy cellphone com,positive
i m really happy with this purchase,positive
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it a stand a belt hook charger that i know doesn t come with every one,positive

i never get dropped calls,positive
nokia was my first non flip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them,positive

it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone which i have to say is probably my favorite function and downloadable java apps,positive
the software you get with this camera is perfect,positive
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ,positive
the greatest thing about the software in my humble is that it reads your cd info,positive
night mode is clear as day,positive
all in all it s a good router if you don t have the cash for a speed booster one,positive
batteries last longer too ,positive
i still give the ipod five stars though as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install though i did follow the onscreen prompts so i ll give apple the benefit of the doubt,positive
it was a very quick setup and installation in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up,positive
i upgraded from nis and the change in performance has not been noticeable,positive
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away,positive
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories desk stand hard case belt clip wall charger etc ,positive
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see,positive
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods,positive
the movie mode is also working great,positive
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps games,positive
reliability build i dropped the player once from about ft and it fell hard but kept on playing,positive
its really cool,positive
unarguably better than apple s and nice earbuds to boot,positive

i got this for christmas and it is a great gift,positive
i still can t believe how fast it starts up,positive

although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone,positive
have a good chunk of my small mp to listen through the speaker phone,positive
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p too much red colours overall not as natural but fewer red eyes ,positive
also i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus,positive
it also works just fine for international calls,positive
this did n t bother me too much because it s still a decent size,positive
mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price,positive
i just got an older mhz system with pc ram and it also runs fine on that,positive
if you are looking for an upgrade this is definitely the phone for you,positive
this is a good deal for music and data storage,positive
the radio feature has superb sound quality,positive
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd s transferred,positive
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything,positive
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying,positive
download it fast to your computer,positive
it s size also makes it ideal for travel,positive
this is a well made and powerful tool,positive

this is really a no brain er,positive

overall though i m very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp player even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod ,positive
excellent diaper disposal unit,positive
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon t slip which was very thoughtful,positive
i have tried other pails but none have compared positively to the champ,positive
it looks sleek and modern,positive
overall i am very pleased with it,positive
i m not sure why all the bad reviews my computer isn t especially slowed down and i have win ,positive
there is no comparison the champ is easy and smell free the genie was difficult to use one handed which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ,positive
and it holds so much music and audio files,positive
this is a must have product for all new moms ,positive
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box,positive
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter s nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers,positive
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface,positive
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there s no difference in working with the files,positive
for the price i don t think you can beat it,positive
it has a handsfree loudspeaker conference and transfer ,positive
however the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the zen micro has to offer,positive
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i ll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so,positive
i wanted this product because i didn t have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended,positive
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer,positive
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one turned everything on in the right order and it was up and running with no problems,positive
this is a great diaper pail,positive
ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned,positive
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want,positive
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound which is all that matters in a mp player ,positive
anted to rate the router higher than star due to its security easy of use etc,positive
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of,positive
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view,positive
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories as always,positive
also very light and portable,positive
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice,positive
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic s and sennheisers,positive
this is the best purchase i ve made in a very long time,positive
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception,positive
for the price it s a very nice dvd player,positive
it takes great pictures,positive

the interface while a bit confusing at first is very easy to navigate after about minutes,positive
for more than a year and it is totally reliable,positive
plus if you order from amazon com they will exchange it for you no problem,positive
by the way i use the norton corporate at work with absolutely no trouble,positive
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites,positive
i m not gonna go into the features cause if you re reading this review you ve probably already looked at them but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ,positive
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon ,positive
the more i work with it the more i love it ,positive
i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice,positive
also it was only after rebate with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player,positive
finally compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb and also consider ease of use,positive
it s easy to use and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch,positive
it is great sounding even with the supplied earbuds,positive
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries excluding new zealand and australia,positive
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jv players,positive
i like the nomad s color better but it s not terribly flashy,positive
i have ripped over songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast and they all sound great,positive
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations,positive
i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed,positive
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod,positive
best in class,positive
it beats apple on the storage space it beats apple on the removable battery and batter life and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel,positive
update i knew that i loved the champ and using the diaper genie at a friend s house really reinforced that ,positive
i am extremely satisfied with this camera,positive
secondly all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires,positive
the service from the supplier was exceptional,positive
cuts are easy and smooth,positive
the price is right,positive
the camera is solid performs well takes good pictures and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder,positive
the photo quality is amazing,positive
the excels as a cell phone thank god,positive
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ,positive
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted,positive
i am very pleased so far,positive
pros large hard drive for the gb and gb are both affordable,positive
the diaper champ couldn t be easier to use,positive
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now this product has excellent range holds a teddy connection ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now,positive
this phone is very user friendly easy to manipulate very convenient to scroll in menu etc,positive
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage,positive
however the battery life is good enough you should n t be overly concerned with turning this phone off,positive
this camera is bulletproof,positive
other than that i think it is the best router for the money,positive
it s so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue,positive
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic ,positive
the software has n t been a hassle for me at all,positive
but if you use all bluetooth accessories as i do its really not an issue,positive
this isn t the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this are you,positive
this thing does everything but washes your dishes,positive
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect,positive
this may be a really cool phone but it s not worth it with t mobile,positive
well the champ has survived it s first year with our son and it is great ,positive
record around hour of video with phillips camcorder pro,positive
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ,positive
i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware which the linksys uses because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used of my ghz laptop s cpu when using the wireless at full speed,positive
stars all the way ,positive
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides,positive
neat feature for self timer allows you to record two different warnings,positive
bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services and are willing to deal with the possibility not the certainty of setup gremlins by all means get the zen micro,positive
this thing seriously is a good player though,positive
it is amazingly small it s hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera,positive
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive ,positive
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise,positive
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific,positive
but it takes gorgeous pictures for a mp camera,positive
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc,positive
ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp player and if you can t figure this out you shouldn t even own one,positive
for the price it is a well spent investment ,positive
in fact i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now years old that i bought one for our new baby s room,positive
the sound is incredible very clean very wide dynamic range of bass midas and highs and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast,positive
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s ,positive
it does have a lense cap but it wo n t let you take pics with it on which is real good,positive
no one has ever come to my house and noticed diaper odor ,positive
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it ,positive
mp is about right for the target market of this camera semi serious amateur photographer ,positive
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files e mp s ,positive
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing,positive
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly,positive
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda,positive
the container is hard to open which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler and you do have to flip the handle carefully which has saved more than a few of her toys too i don t consider these difficulties but features for the older baby,positive
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit,positive
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone web browser and of course the built in camera,positive
when i opened the box i was shocked by the size of this thing it s tiny ,positive
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it,positive
with the right firmware drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive,positive
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive,positive
but it seems to work so well now that i do n t anticipate any problems with it,positive
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse but its really good especially if your files have good sound quality ,positive
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality,positive
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound,positive
if you use software correctly put in all the id tags you will get an awesome database collection from which you can easily access your songs,positive
mixed bag i guess but the price was right,positive
every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail but that is rare and it usually just means that we ve crammed too much in there and need to change the bag,positive
another star performance,positive
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there,positive
i love this pail ,positive
they look fantastic,positive
ripping transferring tunes is basic and pretty fast even on a usb ,positive
it s really a shame because otherwise creative mp players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market,positive
we hardly ever have to charge them get great reception live in chicago and the customization and applications are awesome,positive
the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos i ll use my digital camera instead,positive
fact is it could n t be easier to use,positive
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect,positive
strong points design small comfortable curved and stylish,positive
there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be text ed to you at no cost,positive
long live apple long live macs and long live the ipod ,positive
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny ,positive
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing,positive
panoramic pictures are a very big deal,positive
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size,positive
i have n t had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs,positive
because of it s hidden features no macro vision non regional i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd s,positive
it s worth it,positive
i like the speed control,positive
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing i recommend www no madness net and price wise zens are unbeatable,positive
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes,positive
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs,positive
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp player at that size and the price ,positive
what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g hardware,positive
i was looking for a compact rugged i carry it hiking skiing boating etc camera which is easy to use,positive
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too,positive
having usb makes for very fast transfers,positive
the manual is excellent,positive
sound this is where i love zen the most,positive
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows media player is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service gracenotes ,positive
the battery life is less than stellar but it charges w the quickness,positive
still at least from my perspective a great camera for the money and i m a happy camper ,positive
the signal to noise ratio the ratio of detectable useful data to unusable garbage in say a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better is nice and high at decibels and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods,positive
the creative zen micro at first glance is a dream come true for all mp and music lovers,positive
i use the same store brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it no special diaper trash bags necessary,positive
it s a very intuitive program,positive
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior,positive
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll push button,positive
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ,positive
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it ,positive
in my opinion it s the best camera for the money if you re looking for something that s easy to use small good for travel and provides excellent sharp images,positive
i love this player,positive
the good large lcd screen colorful display good resolution,positive
you ll love it ,positive
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well,positive
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems,positive
canon s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better,positive
battery non issue,positive
holds the odor in nicely ,positive
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up,positive
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won t disappoint any already established nokia phone fans,positive
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is megapixel,positive
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation,positive
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices,positive
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro,positive
i have only used it with the collet and a round over bit but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly,positive
really easy to use,positive
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player everything music file i have is on there with room for about more,positive
i ve got a buddy who s trying to offload his almost new systematic because he saw what this router can do,positive
it does n t smell like burning plastic when you open the drive,positive
the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly and lo and behold a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off,positive
very good every day camera fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos,positive
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx on the pc ,positive
since then i have not found one major problem with it,positive
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date,positive
the software is very easy to use and the transfer is super fast ,positive
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn t have any extra knobs or gizmo s,positive

despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ,positive
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb and i never have any problem at all,positive
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake,positive
pi ii ghz mb rd ram windows xp pro gb hd i was able to uninstall nis and install nis with no trouble,positive
an extra gig of room fm radio voice recorder pim applications with sync to outlook,positive
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos ,positive
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited,positive
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it,positive
the battery life on this phone is surreal,positive
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on your sound quality the sound might crack,positive
the included earphones are pretty good my advice ,positive
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don t need to fuss with a lens cap,positive
this one is really great,positive
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i ve seen,positive
i have had no problem what so ever with this product,positive
other than that this thing is great,positive
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others which are actually starting to get too small,positive
it s faster than wmp,positive
creative did an awesome job with the design,positive
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings and not manual you should be just fine as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen,positive
so far we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine,positive
good looks,positive
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured,positive
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it,positive
powerup is quick and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on,positive
settings for just about everything beautiful pics and beautiful prints,positive

i am quite happy with the camera,positive
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is ,positive
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds,positive
record memos using the built in microphone,positive
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx s green backlight did,positive
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone ,positive
i love the features the interface the size the screen is a delight the camera though i admit i m not much of a camera user so just a toy for me the internet connectivity the quality etc,positive
also the nomad s hours of battery life versus is handy,positive
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing,positive
many of these programs are shareware some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks,positive

i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky,positive
picture quality is excellent,positive
battery life is good for a phone of this size,positive
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player,positive
the plusses are the features look good signal and battery life memory size and robustness,positive
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display long rundown time and a good software suite,positive
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and very importantly the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous,positive
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised,positive
basic usage is easy but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n t used,positive
i just bought this player today and i already love it,positive
i love it ,positive
the setup and transfer process was cake for me,positive
this camera is truely superb,positive

i am really impressed by this dvd player,positive
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take,positive

the back of the player is nice too with water ripples inside the clear white coating,positive

it is very simple to import via photo and then move them to photoshop,positive
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology,positive
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased,positive
it looks great and is loaded with features,positive
it contains the smell from our baby s diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside,positive
camera quality isn t bad for the low resolution,positive
the sound is bright and clear the ability to store any mp s and not just apple approved files is great and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time,positive
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds no big deal,positive
i love that you don t have to purchase expensive refills,positive
i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod mini basically for ease of use and the feel it gives,positive
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ,positive
honestly i love this player,positive
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time,positive
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean,positive
i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more,positive
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons,positive
very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has,positive
despite a critical start this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do which is pretty lofty does more than most does it well is dependable,positive
i love this camera,positive
after getting one for christmas from amazon i m now a believer the digital elph is truly the world s smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures,positive
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be,positive
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections,positive
other plusses changeable battery loads of presets for environments decent construction still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod,positive
x zoom is nice,positive
i really have no complaints over this unit,positive
i upgraded from a very small max camera to this camera with great results,positive
excellent sound quality,positive
when the overall image quality especially natural colours details natural looking of the pictures is the most important thing then this camera its top notch and very impressive,positive
the micro seemed like an ipod for less,positive
but it you won t regret it,positive
it has one more resolution of x and a normal compression mode and it has the x zoom,positive
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ,positive
it s cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges,positive
removable battery,positive
in conclusion this player is beautiful,positive
i liked this one enough to buy another,positive
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility,positive
exposure compensation in stop increments i leave it set on stop to brighten up the default exposure which goes a bit dark for my taste ,positive
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them,positive
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket,positive
the pictures are fabulous and their is a short learning curve to it there are tons of features i have n t even gotten to,positive
i m in high school and this camera is perfect for what i use it for carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to of my friends and of funny things that happen,positive
plus the fact that it used regular trash bags is great,positive
handsfree future is good but not too exciting,positive
i have stored around cd s at kbps on this and have barely touched the available memory,positive
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice,positive
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price ,positive
feels solid in hand,positive
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n t break down like the reviews i ve read,positive
very simple and painless,positive
the bass is deep and the treble is clear,positive
what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has,positive
great camera great investment ,positive
while i m not too keen on their customer service none of the products i have from creative have given me issues i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth,positive
however there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd and online that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro,positive
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific,positive
i m not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery the better firmware or a combination of both factors,positive
i really liked the price,positive
the camera s a work of art science that s understood,positive
this router does everything that it is supposed to do so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it,positive
it doesn t stink ever like some have assumed since it doesn t wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ,positive
have a great and easy to use bundled software,positive
the nomad is not ugly it is not that big it comfortably fits in my pocket or heavy and the controls are not hard to get used to,positive
the diaper champ is the best ,positive
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers,positive
i am enjoying my phone a lot,positive
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows k machine,positive
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution i had to have the s ,positive
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned,positive
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under ,positive
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely as all of my pictures have thus far ,positive
moreover apart from the plastic cable cover the camera has a nice solid feel about it and it s so tiny i take it with me wherever i go,positive
if you re looking for a hp plunge router the hitachi m v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget,positive
we don t have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ,positive
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used,positive
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price,positive
i found it intuitive to use i did n t read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ,positive
thankfully creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place,positive
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera ,positive
i recently bought the linksys wrt g router and have been very happy with the router itself,positive
the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player,positive
the panorama setting is unbelievable ,positive
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it,positive
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access and it takes silent movies,positive
however after playing with it for three weeks now i m convinced the zen micro is superior,positive
if you are using linux and you want to use gprs to connect to the net i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter,positive
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen,positive
great colors pictures and white balance,positive
so why the small digital elph rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality size ,positive
month no problems great phone i m very pleased with my phone,positive
it s being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers headphone jack player locking up etc ,positive
all in all though i m very happy with my new mp player,positive
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ,positive
check traffic com for la traffic on the ,positive
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer,positive
and so far i have been very very happy with my zen micro,positive
further the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod,positive
first and foremost it will take better pic s than most film camera s,positive
it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented,positive
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch,positive
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that s not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection,positive
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days,positive
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus,positive
i ve connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa ,positive
i was looking for something that wasn t too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail,positive
the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it,positive
i do not count this as a negative however because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ,positive
the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes,positive
transferring music is a breeze i don t subscribe to music services but as mentioned on other reviews micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes,positive
it works well enough so far for me to be satisfied with it and it s possible that i m missing something,positive
